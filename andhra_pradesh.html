  <h2> HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY OF ANDHRA PRADESH</h2>

  <img src="andhra_geo.jpg" class="image" height="397px" width="450px">
  <P>Andhra Pradesh, state of India, located in the southeastern part of the subcontinent. It is bounded by the Indian
    states of Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the southwest and west,
    Telangana to the northwest and north, and Odisha to the northeast. The eastern boundary is a 600-mile (970-km)
    coastline along the Bay of Bengal. Telangana was a region within Andhra Pradesh
    for almost six decades, but in 2014 it was carved off to form a separate state. The capital of both Andhra Pradesh
    and Telangana is Hyderabad, in west-central Telangana.</P>
  <P>The state draws its name from the Andhra people, who have inhabited the area since antiquity and developed their
    own language, Telugu. Andhra Pradesh came into existence in its present form
    in 1956 as a result of the demand of the Andhras for a separate state. Although it is primarily agricultural, the
    state has some mining activity and a significant amount of industry. Area 106,204
    square miles (275,068 square km). Pop. (2011) 84,665,533.</P>

  <H2>RELIEF, DRAINAGE AND SOIL</H2>

  <img src="Penneru-River-Andhra-Pradesh-India.webp" class="image" height="397px" width="450px">
  <P> The state has three main physiographic regions: the coastal plain to the east, extending from the Bay of Bengal to
    the mountain ranges; the mountain ranges themselves, the Eastern Ghats,
    which form the western flank of the coastal plain; and, in the southwest, the plateau to the west of the Ghats. The
    coastal plain, also known as the Andhra region, runs almost the entire length
    of the state and is watered by several rivers, flowing from west to east through the hills into the bay. The deltas
    formed by the most important of those rivers—the Godavari and the Krishna make
    up the central part of the plains, an area of fertile alluvial soil.</P>
  <P>The Eastern Ghats are part of a larger mountain system extending from central India to the far south and running
    parallel to the east coast. Interrupted by the great river
    valleys, the mountains do not form a continuous range. They have highly porous soils on their flanks.</P>
  <P>The plateau region in the southwestern portion of the state part of the Deccan (peninsular India) and commonly
    called Rayalaseema—is composed of gneissic rock (gneiss being a foliated rock formed in Earth’s interior under
    conditions of heat and pressure). It is highest in the far southwest, where elevations exceed 2,000 feet (600
    metres), sloping downward toward the northeast. The Penneru River forms the main drainage system. As the result of
    erosion, the plateau is a region of graded valleys, with red sandy soil and isolated hills. Black soil is also found
    in certain parts of the area.
  <P>

  <H2>CLIMATE </H2>
  <P> A summer that lasts from March to June, a season of tropical rains that runs from July to September, and a winter
    that lasts from October to February constitute the three seasons of Andhra Pradesh.
    Summers are extraordinarily hot and humid, with maximum daily temperatures exceeding 95 °F (35 °C) and even
    surpassing 104 °F (40 °C) in the central portion of the state. Summer nightly minimums drop
    to below about 70 °F (20 °C) only in the far southwest. Winters are somewhat cooler, with January maximum
    temperatures between 86 and 95 °F (30 and 35 °C) in all but the northeastern portion of the state.
    Winter lows drop below about 60 °F (15 °C) only in the extreme northeast.</P>
  <P>Annual precipitation, which derives largely from the southwest monsoon rains, generally decreases toward the
    southwestern plateau area. Coastal areas receive about 40 to 47 inches (1,000 to 1,200 mm)
    per year, while the westernmost part of the plateau may receive only half that much. Rainfall totals in portions of
    the northeastern mountains exceed 47 inches and can be as high as 55 inches (1,400 mm).</P>


  <H2>PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE</H2>

  <img src="forest-cover-Nallamala-Range-Eastern-Ghats-Andhra.jpg" class="image" height="397px" width="450px">
  <P>Mangrove swamps and palm trees fringe the coastal plain of Andhra Pradesh, while thorny vegetation covers the
    scattered hills of the plateau. About one-fifth of the state’s total area
    is forest-covered, with dense woodlands occurring primarily in the Eastern Ghats. The forests consist of both moist
    deciduous and dry savanna vegetation; teak, rosewood, wild fruit trees,
    and bamboo are plentiful. Elsewhere in the state, neem (which produces an aromatic oil), banyan, mango, and pipal
    (or Bo; Ficus religiosa) are among the common trees. Andhra Pradesh also has
    an array of flowering vegetation, including jasmine, rose, and a number of endemic species—particularly in the hilly
    region of the Eastern Ghats.</P>
  <P>Animal life, apart from common domestic types (dogs, cats, and cattle), includes tigers, blackbucks, hyenas, sloth
    bears, gaurs, and chital, which abound in the hills and forest areas.
    There also are dozens of species of birds, including flamingos and pelicans as well as some rare varieties, such as
    the Jerdon’s courser (Rhinoptilus bitorquatus), which is found in the
    thorny or scrub-covered areas surrounding the Eastern Ghats. The eastern coast is a nesting ground for sea turtles.
  </P>


  <H2>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING</H2>
  <P>Agriculture, dominated by the production of food grains, is a major, although declining, sector of the state’s
    economy, in terms of value. Andhra Pradesh is one of the leading rice-growing
    states in the country and is a major producer of India’s tobacco. The state’s rivers—particularly the Godavari and
    the Krishna, but also the Penneru—account for its agricultural importance.</P>
  <P>For a long time the rivers’ benefits were restricted to the coastal districts of the Andhra region, which had the
    best irrigation facilities. Beginning in the mid-20th century, however, great
    efforts were made to tap the waters of the Godavari, Krishna, Penneru, and other rivers by constructing dams and
    reservoirs that benefit both coastal and drier upland regions. Canal irrigation
    in the Rayalaseema region of the plateau has given rise to agro-industrial complexes rivaling those of coastal
    Andhra Pradesh. The Nagarjuna Sagar multipurpose project, diverting the waters of
    the Krishna for irrigation, has substantially increased the production of rice and sugarcane. Rice flour, rice-bran
    oil, paints and varnishes, soaps and detergents, cardboard and other packaging
    materials, and cattle feed are all produced from local paddy rice. Other agricultural commodities grown statewide
    include other cereal grains, pulses (peas, beans, and lentils), peanuts (groundnuts),
    corn (maize), and cotton—all of which are processed locally as well—and a variety of fruits and vegetables.</P>
  <P> Animal husbandry has increased significantly in Andhra Pradesh, especially since the start of the 21st century.
    Livestock raising contributes roughly half as much in overall value as crop production. Animals raised include
    cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. Dairy and egg production have grown dramatically.</P>


  <H2>RESOURCES AND POWER </H2>

  <img src="dam_ap.jpg" height="397px" class="image" width="450px">
  <P>Among the state’s principal mineral resources are asbestos, mica, manganese, barite, and high-grade coal. Low-grade
    iron ore is found in the southern parts of the state. Andhra Pradesh produces a major share of the country’s barite.
    It is the only state in southern India that possesses significant coal reserves. In the early 21st century, large
    deposits of natural gas were discovered onshore and offshore in the basins of the Godavari and Krishna rivers. The
    diamond mines of Golconda were once renowned worldwide for producing the Koh-i-noor diamond and other famous stones;
    efforts have been made to revive production in the area. Quartz, limestone, and graphite also occur. The state has
    established a mining and metal-trading corporation to lead the exploitation of its mineral resources.</P>
  <P>Most of Andhra Pradesh’s energy is produced by thermal generators in the public sector. Hydroelectric power
    stations—notably those on the Krishna River along the Telangana border at Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar—provide an
    important secondary source of energy. In addition, the government has established several wind farms. A number of
    private companies operate generators powered by natural gas; they also have worked to develop wind, biomass, and
    other nonconventional power sources.</P>

  <H2>MANUFACTURING</H2>
  <P>Andhra Pradesh since the mid-20th century has become one of the most highly industrialized states in India.
    Industry—including mining, utilities, and construction as well as manufacturing—contributes roughly the same value
    to the state income as does agriculture, although manufacturing itself accounts for only a small proportion of the
    overall income. Industries such as shipbuilding, aeronautics, and the manufacture of electrical equipment, machine
    tools, and drugs have been established in the Visakhapatnam area. Private enterprises, many of them located in and
    around the urban agglomeration of Vijayawada and Guntur in the east-central region, produce chemicals, textiles,
    cement, fertilizers, processed foods, petroleum derivatives, and cigarettes.</P>
  <P>A number of important enterprises of moderate size, such as sugar factories, are scattered across the medium-size
    and smaller urban areas. There is a mammoth steel plant at Visakhapatnam, where raw materials and port facilities
    are easily accessible; an oil refinery also is located there, as is a large shipbuilding yard. The increase in power
    generated by hydroelectric and thermoelectric projects since the late 20th century has benefited industrialization
    and irrigation.</P>

  <H2>TRANSPORTATION</H2>


  <img src="bus_ap.jpg" height="397px" width="450px" class="image">
  <P>There are several airports in the state, notably at Vijayawada, Tirupati, and Visakhapatnam. An extensive road and
    rail system connects Andhra Pradesh with most other parts of India. Bus transportation, a large share of which is
    privately operated, offers facilities for express travel between various cities. The river canals in coastal areas,
    especially the saltwater Kommamur (Buckingham) Canal running parallel to the coast from the Krishna River south to
    Chennai (Madras) in Tamil Nadu, are used for cargo transportation. Visakhapatnam is a major international seaport.
