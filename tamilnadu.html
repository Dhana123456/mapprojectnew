    <h2>HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY OF TAMILNADU</h2>
    <img src="maamallapuram.jpg" alt="maamallapuram" class="image" height="350px" width="500px">
    <P>

        The State of Tamil Nadu has a hoary antiquity. Though early sangam classics throw historical references, we pass
        to recorded history only from the Pallavas.
        The southern states of India were under the hegemony of the Cholas, the Cheras and the Pandyas for centuries.
        The Pallavas held supremacy from about the second quarter
        of the fourth century A.D. They were the originators of the famous Dravidian style of temple architecture. The
        last Pallava ruler was Aparajita, in whose reign the later
        Cholas under Vijayalaya and Aditya asserted themselves by about the 10th century. At the end of the 11th
        century, Tamil Nadu was ruled by several dynasties like the Chalukyas,
        Cholas and Pandyas. In the two centuries that followed, the imperial Cholas gained paramountcy over South
        India. </P>

    <P>
        Muslims gradually strengthened their position, which led to the establishment of the Bahamani Sultanate, by the
        middle of the 14th century. At the same time, the Vijayanagar
        Kingdom quickly consolidated itself and extended its sway over the whole of South India, and at the close of the
        century, Vijayanagar became the supreme power in South. However,
        it crumbled at the battle of Talikota in 1564 to the confederate forces of the Deccan Sultans. </P>

    <P>
        Even during the period of the tumultuous confusion that followed the battle of Talikota, European commercial
        interest had appeared as rivals in the area of South India.
        The Portuguese, the Dutch, the French and the English came in quick succession and established trading centres
        known as 'Factories'. East India Company, which had established
        its factory at Masulipatnam (now in Andhra Pradesh) in 1611, gradually annexed territories by encouraging enmity
        among the native rulers. Tamil Nadu was one of the first of
        British settlements in India. The State is the successor to the old Madras Presidency, which covered the bulk of
        the southern peninsula in 1901. The composite Madras State
        was later reorganised, and the present Tamil Nadu was formed.
        Tamil Nadu is bounded on north by Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, on the west by Kerala, on the east by the Bay of
        Bengal, and on the south by the Indian Ocean. </P>

        Improvement and Farmers Turnover Projects' executed with assistance from World Bank. The major irrigation system
        covering one-third of irrigated extent in Tamil Nadu,
        namely tank irrigation system has been given due regard for development under WRCP, and 620 tanks maintained by
        Public Works Department falling under Palar, Vaigai, and

    <H2>RESOURCE AND POWER</H2>
    <p> The total installed capacity for electricity in the State is 8,249 MW. The installed capacity of State Sector is

        ore. The opencast lignite mine at Neyveli, in the north-central part of the state, is among the largest in
        India, and its products are used to fuel a thermal-power plant that provides much of the state’s electricity.
        The bulk of Tamil Nadu’s energy comes from thermal stations, but hydroelectric plants—especially along the
        Kaveri River and its tributaries—provide an important secondary source of energy. The state also is a leader in
        wind-power generation.</P><BR>

    <h2> EDUCATION</h2>
    <img src="school_tamilnadu.jpg" alt="school_tamilnadu" class="image" height="350px" width="500px">
    <P> Tens of thousands of public and private primary, middle, and high schools are scattered across the state of
        Tamil Nadu. In addition, there are numerous arts and science colleges, medical colleges, engineering colleges,
        polytechnic institutes, and industrial training institutes. Among the most prominent of Tamil Nadu’s
        universities are the University of Madras (1857) and Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University
        (1989), both in Chennai, Annamalai University (1929) in Chidambaram; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (1971)
        in Coimbatore; and Madurai Kamaraj University (1966) in Madurai. The Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha (1918)
        in Chennai and the Gandhigram Rural University (1956) in Gandhigram, in southwest-central Tamil Nadu, are the
        two institutes of national importance that are engaged in popularizing the Hindi language and Mahatma Gandhi’s
        concept of rural higher education, respectively. Tamil University (1981) near Thanjavur (Tanjore), in the
        eastern part of the state, focuses on the study of Tamil language, literature, and culture.</P>
    <h2>PLANTS AND ANIMALS</h2>
    <P>Forests cover roughly 15 percent of the state. At the highest elevations in the Western Ghats, the mountains
        support subalpine vegetation. Along the eastern side of the Western Ghats and in the hills of the northern and
        central districts, the plant life is a mixture of evergreen and deciduous species, some of which are markedly
        adapted to arid conditions.</P>
    <P>Tamil Nadu has several national parks and more than a dozen wildlife and bird sanctuaries. Among the most notable
        of these protected areas are the Mudlumbai Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park in the Nilgiri Hills and the
        large Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park at the southern tip of the Western Ghats. These
        sanctuaries provide a safe habitat for a broad spectrum of fauna, including elephants, gaurs (wild cattle),
        Nilgiri tahrs (goatlike mammals), wild boars, sloth bears, and various species of deer. Tigers, leopards, and an
        assortment of primates, including macaques, langurs, and lorises, also inhabit these areas. Venomous king cobras
        are among the many species of reptiles that make their home in Tamil Nadu. Woodpeckers and flycatchers are
        common woodland birds; aquatic birds find a haven at the Vedantangal sanctuary in the south-central part of the
        state</P>
