    <H2> HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY OF KERALA</H2>
    <img src="dam.png" class="image">

    <P>Kerala, southwestern coastal state of India. It is a small state, constituting only about 1 percent of the total
        area of the country.
        Kerala stretches for about 360 miles (580 km) along the Malabar Coast, varying in width from roughly 20 to 75
        miles (30 to 120 km).
        It is bordered by the states of Karnataka (formerly Mysore) to the north and Tamil Nadu to the east and by the
        Arabian Sea to the south and west;
        it also surrounds Mahe, a segment of the state of Puducherry, on the northwestern coast. The capital is
        Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum).</P>

        <P>Although isolated from the Indian interior by the mountainous belt of the Western Ghats, Kerala has been exposed
        to many foreign influences
        via its long coastline; consequently, the state has developed a unique culture within the subcontinent, not only
        with a diverse religious tradition
        but also with its own language, Malayalam. Also notable is the high social status that continues to be accorded
        to women of Kerala, owing to the former
        strength of a matrilineal kinship system. Area 15,005 square miles (38,863 square km). Pop. (2011) 33,387,677.
        Kerala is first mentioned (as Keralaputra) in a 3rd-century-BCE rock inscription left by the Mauryan emperor
        Ashoka. In the last centuries BCE this region became famous among the Greeks and Romans for its spices
        (especially pepper). During the first five centuries CE the region was a part of Tamilakam—the territory of the
        Tamils—and thus was sometimes partially controlled by the eastern Pandya and Chola dynasties, as well as by the
        Cheras. In the 1st century Jewish immigrants arrived, and, according to local Christian tradition, St. Thomas
        the Apostle visited Kerala in the same century (see St. Thomas [Mar Thoma] Christians).

    <h2>CULTURE LIFE</h2>

    <img src="performance-Taliparamba-Kerala-India.jpg" class="image" height="397px" width="450px">
    <P> The cultural heritage of Kerala reflects extensive interaction with diverse communities from antiquity to the
        present. With an array of ancient Hindu temples
        with copper-clad roofs, later mosques with “Malabar gables” (triangular projections at the rooftops), and
        Baroque churches from the Portuguese colonial era,
        the state’s architecture offers a chronicle of the social, spiritual, and political history of the area. Other
        characteristically Keralan art forms include intricate
        paintings on wood, thematic murals, and a remarkable variety of indoor and outdoor lamps (from which the state
        has earned the sobriquet “Land of Lamps”).</P>

        <P>Literature and learning, in both Tamil and Sanskrit, have flourished since the 2nd century CE; meanwhile, the
        Malayalam language, though an offshoot of Tamil,
        has absorbed much from Sanskrit and also has a prolific literature. Notable names in Malayalam poetry are
        Tunchattu Eluttaccan and Kuncan Nampiyar among classical
        poets and Kumaran Asan and Vallathol in the 20th century. In 1889 Chandu Menon wrote Indulekha, the first
        outstanding novel in Malayalam, for which he received a
        certificate from Queen Victoria. Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, who produced hundreds of works before his death in
        1999, has remained among the most widely read Malayali
        novelists.</P><BR>


    <h2>RELIEF AND DRAINAGE</h2>

    <P> Kerala is a region of great natural beauty. In the eastern part of the state, Anai Peak (8,842 feet [2,695
        metres]), the highest peak of peninsular India, crowns
        the Western Ghats. Descending from the rocky highlands westward toward the coastal plain is a stretch of
        farmlands, with different crops cultivated at different elevations.<BR>
        Along the coast, a linked chain of lagoons and backwaters form the so-called Venice of India. Among the more
        important rivers that flow to the Arabian Sea are the Ponnani
        (Bharatapuzha), Periyar, Chalakudi, and Pamba.</P><BR>

    <H2> CLIMATE </H2>
    <img src="kerala_cover.jpg" height="397px" class="image" width="450px">

    <p> The climate of Kerala is equable and varies little from season to season. Throughout the year, daily
        temperatures usually rise from the low 70s F (low 20s C)
        into the 80s F (27 to 32 °C). The state is directly exposed to the southwest monsoon, which prevails from July
        through September, but it also receives rain from
        the reverse (northeast) monsoon, which blows in October and November. Precipitation averages about 115 inches
        (3,000 mm) annually statewide, with some slopes receiving
        more than 200 inches (5,000 mm).</p><BR>

    <h2>PLANT AND ANIMALS</h2>
    <P> The watery coastal zones of Kerala are interspersed with coconut palm groves, while much of the Western Ghats
        and riverine areas are covered with rainforests and monsoon
        forests (tropical deciduous forests). Rolling grasslands are typical of the upland region. This diverse natural
        environment is home to an extraordinary array of wildlife.
        Mammals include sambar deer, gaurs (wild cattle), Nilgiri tahrs (wild goatlike animals; Hemitragus hylocrius,
        or, by some classifications, Nilgiritragus hylocrius), elephants,
        leopards, tigers, bonnet monkeys, rare lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus), and Hanuman and Nilgiri langurs
        (Semnopithecus entellus and Trachypithecus johnii, respectively).
        King cobras (Ophiophagus hannah) are among the notable reptiles, while peacocks and hornbills are common birds.
        The state has several national parks and wildlife sanctuaries,
        among which the Periyar National Park and Tiger Reserve is the largest.</P><BR>


    <h2>HEALTH AND WELFARE</h2>

    <P>The state maintains a relatively high standard of health service. A comprehensive health insurance plan is
        available for workers in a number of professions, and
        free medical treatment is offered in many hospitals, health centres, and dispensaries. Among the top priorities
        of government health schemes have been the establishment
        of health care facilities in rural areas, the promotion of family planning, prevention of blindness, and control
        of communicable diseases such as leprosy, tuberculosis, and
        malaria.</P><BR>


    <h2>EDUCATION</h2>

    <P> Kerala has one of the most advanced educational systems and highest levels of literacy in India. Elementary
        education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14.
        There are primary, middle, and secondary schools, as well as polytechnical and industrial training institutes,
        arts and science colleges, and professional colleges.
        Kerala also has several universities, including the University of Kerala (1937) in Thiruvananthapuram, the
        University of Calicut (1968) in Kozhikode, Cochin University of
        Science and Technology (1971) in Kochi, and Kerala Agricultural University (1971) in Thrissur.</P><BR>


    <h2>MANUFRACTURING, SERVICES AND LABOUR</h2>
    <P> Aside from agriculture, manufacturing and service activities are important contributors to Kerala’s economy.
        Traditional cottage industries, such as weaving, the production
        of coconut fibre, and cashew processing, employ many workers in the manufacturing sector. Of the medium- and
        large-scale industries, food processing is the principal employer.
        Other major manufactures include fertilizers, chemicals, electrical equipment, titanium, aluminum, plywood,
        ceramics, and synthetic fabrics. Banking, finance, and other
        components of the services sector also employ a significant segment of the state’s workforce. However,
        unemployment has remained acute, with the state’s high level of
        education among the jobless exacerbating the problem.</P><BR>

    <h2>TRANSPORTATION</h2>

    <img src="vegetation-waterways-state-Kerala-India.jpg" class="image" height="397px" width="450px">
    <P>Kerala has well-developed road and railway systems. It is connected with the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
        by national highways. A railway coming from the east through the
        Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats meets with a railway running from north to south through the state and on to
        Kanniyakumari, the southernmost town of India. There is a major
        port at Kochi and intermediate ports at Kozhikode, Alappuzha, and Neendakara (near Thiruvananthapuram); all
        handle coastal and foreign traffic. Kochi also has major shipyard
        and oil refining facilities and serves as a district headquarters for the Indian coast guard and as a regional
        headquarters for the navy. More than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of
        inland waterways form the main arteries for carrying bulk freight to and from the ports. Thiruvananthapuram,
        Kozhikode, and Kochi have international airports.</P><BR>


    <h2>RESOURCE AND POWER </h2>

    <P> Kerala lacks major reserves of fossil fuels. However, there are moderate deposits of ilmenite (the principal ore
        of titanium), rutile (titanium dioxide), and monazite
        (a mineral consisting of cerium and thorium phosphates), all of which are found in beach sands. Other minerals
        include limestone, iron ores, and bauxite (the principal
        ore of aluminum). The state is especially known for its high-quality kaolin (china clay), which is used to make
        porcelain.<BR>

        Kerala has great hydroelectric potential, with some two dozen hydroelectric stations operating within the state.
        Several thermal plants supply additional energy, and in
        the late 20th century the state began to establish wind farms. Despite its wealth of renewable resources for
        power generation, Kerala has continued to import some of its
        electricity from elsewhere in India.</P><BR>

    <h2>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING</h2>
 
    <img src="Fishing-nets-state-Kerala-India.jpg" class="image" height="397px" weigth="450px">

    <P>Agriculture is the state’s main economic activity. Commercial plantings on less than half of the total land under
        cultivation earn a sizable amount of foreign exchange but
        have necessitated the importation of food for local consumption. Kerala’s principal cash crops are rubber,
        coffee, and tea, which are cultivated in plantations on the slopes
        of the foothills, as well as areca nut, cardamom, cashew nut, coconut, ginger, and pepper. The major food crops
        are rice, pulses (e.g., peas and beans), sorghum, and tapioca.
        Commercial poultry farming is well developed.</P>

        <P>The forests yield valuable timbers such as ebony, rosewood, and teak. In addition, Kerala’s woodlands supply
        industrial raw materials such as bamboo (used in the paper and
        rayon industries), wood pulp, charcoal, gums, and resins. The state is also a national leader in fish
        production. Sardines, tunas, mackerels, and prawns are among the principal
        products of the industry.</P><BR>
