    <H2>HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY OF TELANGANA</H2>
    <P>Telangana, also spelled Telengana or Telingana, constituent state of south-central India. It is bordered by the
        states of Maharashtra to the north, Chhattisgarh and Odisha to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the southeast
        and south, and Karnataka to the west. The area of what is now Telangana constituted the north-central and
        northeastern portions of Andhra Pradesh for almost six decades, but on June 2, 2014, that territory was calved
        off to form a separate state. The capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh is Hyderabad, in west-central
        Telangana.</P>

    <H2>LAND</H2>
    <img src="Telangana-India-Golconda-Fort-Qutb-Shahi-dynasty.jpg" class="image" alt="land" height="350px"
        width="500px">
    <P>Telangana is situated largely in an upland region of the Deccan (peninsular India). Much of its surface area is
        occupied by the Telangana Plateau in the north and the Golconda Plateau in the south and is composed of gneissic
        rock (gneiss being a foliated rock formed within Earth’s interior under conditions of heat and pressure). The
        average elevation of the plateau area is about 1,600 feet (500 metres), higher in the west and southwest and
        sloping downward toward the east and northeast, where it meets the discontinuous line of the Eastern Ghats
        ranges. Drainage is dominated by the basins of the Godavari River in the north and the Krishna River in the
        south. As a result of erosion, the topography of the plateau region consists of graded valleys with red sandy
        soil and isolated hills. Black soil is also found in certain parts of the area.</P>
    <P>Telangana has three seasons: summer, from March to June; a period of tropical rains from July to September; and
        winter, from October to February. Summers are warm to hot and dry, with temperatures often nearing or exceeding
        100 °F (38 °C). Annual precipitation, which derives largely from the rainy southwest monsoon winds, varies
        somewhat across the state. It averages about 35 inches (900 mm) per year, although the annual total often varies
        considerably from the average and can be as little as 20 inches (500 mm) in drier areas. Average minimum
        temperatures in Hyderabad reach about 60 °F (15 °C) in January and February and usually read in the low 50s F
        (about 10 to 12 °C) at higher elevations.</P>
    <P>Thorny vegetation covers the scattered hills of the plateau areas, while dense woodlands are found in the
        northeast along and near the Godavari River. The forests, covering about one-fourth of the land area, consist of
        both moist deciduous and dry savanna vegetation; teak, rosewood, wild fruit trees, and bamboo are plentiful.
        Elsewhere in the state, neem (which produces an aromatic oil), banyan, mango, and pipal (or Bo; Ficus religiosa)
        are among the common trees.</P>

    <H2>PEOPLE</H2>
    <img src="women-dress-Hyderabad-India-Telangana.jpg" class="image" alt="people" height="350px" width="500px">
    <P>Telangana lies at a crossroads between northern and southern India, and it has a diverse population. In general,
        the state’s various communities are identified more readily by a combination of language, religion, and social
        class or caste than they are by specific ethnic affiliation. The Dravidian language Telugu is the official and
        most widely spoken language in the state. A small minority speaks Urdu, a language primarily of northern India
        and Pakistan. Most of the remaining groups speak border-area languages, including Hindi, Kannada, and Marathi.
        Lambadi (Banjari) and other languages are spoken by the state’s Scheduled Tribes (the official designation for
        indigenous minority peoples). The great majority of Telangana’s residents practice Hinduism, while smaller
        numbers of the population follow Islam. Some one-fourth of the state’s people are members of Scheduled Castes
        (the official designation for those formerly called “untouchables”) and Scheduled Tribes.</P>

    <H2> ECONOMY</H2>
    <P>Telangana’s economy was long dominated by agriculture, notably the production of rice. The state’s rivers,
        particularly the Godavari and the Krishna, have been tapped to provide irrigation for the dry interior, although
        many areas still depend on the somewhat unpredictable monsoon rainfall. In addition to rice, other important
        crops are corn (maize) and cotton. The Nagarjuna Sagar multipurpose dam project on the border with Andhra
        Pradesh, which diverts the waters of the Krishna for irrigation, has substantially increased the production of
        rice and sugarcane. Rice flour, rice-bran oil, paints and varnishes, soaps and detergents, cardboard and other
        packaging materials, and cattle feed are all produced from local paddy rice. Other agricultural commodities
        include chili peppers, sorghum, pulses (peas, beans, and lentils), castor beans, and peanuts (groundnuts), as
        well as a variety of tropical fruits. Livestock raising and aquaculture are also important, each accounting for
        a small but still significant component of annual economic output.</P>
    <P>The state’s woodlands annually yield high-quality timber, such as teak and eucalyptus. Non-timber forest
        products—including sal seeds (from which an edible oil is extracted), tendu leaves (for rolling cigarettes), gum
        karaya (a type of emulsifier), and bamboo—are also important. The state government initiated a major
        reforestation program.</P>

        <h2>AGRICULTURE</h2>
        <img src="initiative-towards-making-agriculture-a-profitable-business-for-farmers-in-telangana.jpg"
            class="image" alt="maamallapuram" height="350px" width="500px">
        <P>The Department of Agriculture has been created mainly to provide Agricultural Extension services to farmers
            and to transfer the latest technical knowledge to the farming community. The objectives of the Department
            are to assess requirements of agriculture inputs well in advance and to regulate their production and
            monitor timely supply of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, implements, credit etc., to farmers. The
            Department also performs the statutory functions under various acts and regulations (i.e., quality control)
            to ensure supply of quality inputs i.e., Seeds, Fertilizers and Pesticides to farmers etc.</P>
        <P>Rice is the major food crop and staple food of the state. Other important crops are tobacco, mango, cotton,
            and sugar cane. Agriculture has been the chief source of income for the state's economy. Important rivers of
            India, the Godavari, Krishna flow through the state, providing irrigation. Apart from major rivers, there
            are small rivers as Tunga Bhadra, Bima, Dindi, Kinnerasani, Manjeera, Manair, Penganga, Pranahitha,
            peddavagu and Taliperu. There are many multi-state irrigation projects in development, including Godavari
            River Basin Irrigation Projects and Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, the world's highest masonry dam.</P>
        <H2>EDUCATION</H2>
        <img src="school_telangana.jpg" alt="school_telangana" class="image" height="350px" width="500px">

            Secondary Education Telangana or Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), ICSE, IB, IGCSE. Government of
            Telangana is working towards building the excellent school system. Telangana is the 5th place for education
            passing percentage of 2018. Telangana has implemented various skill set in education system to make
            improvement on all the areas.

            The Telangana State Government established the Telangana Minorities Residential Educational Institutions
            Society in 2015 to provide residential education for children from minority populations.</P>
